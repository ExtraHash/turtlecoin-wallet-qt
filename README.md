# turtlecoin-mobile-wallet-qt
A rewrite of TonChan in C++ with Qt for (hopefully) faster wallet syncing performance

Note that the subfolder [src/wallet-backend/](src/wallet-backend/) is based on the TurtleCoin core code, with a lot of stuff ripped out.
It has been included in the source tree because qtcreator is hard to use...

## Building
lol, good luck
